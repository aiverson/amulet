  Could not deduce show (apply 'f 'a) from the context
    forall 'a. show (apply 'f 'a)

  • Note: this constraint can not be quantified over
    because it originated from a method in an instance.

  • Possible fix: add it to the instance context

  Arising in the the expression
   │ 
24 │   let show (Mk x) = "Mk " ^ show x
   │                             ^^^^^^
  • Note: apply is an associated type, and so may not be injective
