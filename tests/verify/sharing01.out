sharing01.ml[3:5 ..3:5]: warning
  Polymorphic values are not shared
  │ 
3 │ let x = ref None
  │     ^
  • Note: The variable x (of type ref (option 'a)) behaves as if
    it were a function, since it was generalised,
    and is polymorphic.

  • Suggestion: if this is not intentional, use a type annotation
    constraint the type of x.
