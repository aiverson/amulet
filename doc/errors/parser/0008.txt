This instance's head could not be parsed. Every instance should be
composed of a (lower case) class name applied to at least one argument.

    instance eq int

Instances may also impose additional constraints on their arguments,
such as requiring the elements of a list to also have an instance of
this class.

    instance eq 'a => eq (list 'a)
