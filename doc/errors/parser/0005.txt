A comment was opened (using `(*`​), but never closed. Add
`*)`​ in order to end the comment.

1. Note that comments may be nested, meaning that you may need to close
   multiple comments.

2. It is possible to accidentally introduce a comment, especially when
   using operator sections. In these cases, add a space within the
   section's parenthesis.

   The most common case of this is referring to the multiplication (or
   product type) operators, which would be spelled `(*)`​. However,
   this is an unclosed comment, so write `( * )`​ instead.
