When a data constructor is used as a type expression, we require that
the type of the constructor be *promotable* to a kind, and furthermore
that the promoted kind be useful.

This means that, currently, constructors that take records as arguments
can't be promoted. Here is what can be promoted:

1. Function types, qualified types and quantified types
   (`a -> b`, `a => b` and `forall a. b` respectively)
2. Tuple types (using the promoted tuple types)
3. All type constructors, and applications thereof
4. Promoted data constructors, and applications thereof
5. Type variables, wildcards
6. The `int`, `bool` and `string` types
