   Commentary:

   Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

   Obviously, this module begs a bit of explaining. Since the kind
   inference engine in Types.Infer isn't usable in Type Typed, here we
   implement a very dumb wellformedness check that will reject
   obviously-wrong types, such as { int | field : type}. Hopefully in
   the future we alleviate the need for this module with a *proper* kind
   system

   Unfortunately, this is the best I can do right now.


   Checks we peform:
    [1] Polymorphic record types' holes may only be instanced to
    something "row-y", i.e. an exact record, another polymorphic record,
    or a type variable. All other instancings are malformed.
